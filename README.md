This gonna be an Web application for shortening long URLs. The whole project will be written in Golang.

This Project is part of my [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) Challenge.

**ToDos:**

- [ ] MongoDB implementation as backend
- [ ] Containerize the application and database
- [ ] CI Pipeline to check the Code Quality with SonarQube

Maybe more ToDos will be added.
